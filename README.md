# Library Smart Borrowing System

The **Library Smart Borrowing System** is a project designed to streamline the process of borrowing books from a library using advanced **scheduling algorithms**. The system employs **FIFO (First In, First Out)** and **Priority Scheduling** techniques to manage book requests effectively.

The script provides an efficient way to handle book requests, track which books are available, and ensure the right books are borrowed according to their request order or priority.

## Key Features and Functions:

### 1. Book Listing:
- The system maintains a comprehensive list of available books.
- Users can view the available books and request to borrow them.

### 2. FIFO and Priority Scheduling:
- The system processes book requests using **FIFO** or **Priority Scheduling**, depending on the user’s choice.
- Requests are queued in a fair and orderly manner, ensuring that books are lent out based on the order or priority of requests.

### 3. Request Logging:
- Each book request is logged, including details such as the request time and the requester's information.
- The system tracks the **status of each book** (available or borrowed).

### 4. Automated Processing:
- The system automatically processes requests, determining whether a book is available and updating its status once it is borrowed.

### 5. Flexible and User-Friendly:
- The system allows library staff or users to manage book requests based on FIFO or priority order, providing flexibility in managing the library’s lending process.

## Benefits:
- **Efficient Book Management**: The system automates the borrowing process, ensuring a fair and smooth flow of requests.
- **Time-Saving**: Automating the book request and borrowing process saves time for both library staff and users.
- **Priority Handling**: Priority scheduling ensures that urgent or high-priority requests are handled before general requests.
- **Transparency**: Request logs provide an easy way to track borrowed books and ensure accountability.
